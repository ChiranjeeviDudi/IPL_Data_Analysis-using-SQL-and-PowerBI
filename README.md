# IPL_Data_Analysis_Project using PostgreSQL and PowerBI
This project is developed for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset for finding the key values of the data very easily.
In this project i have used tools like PostgreSQL and PowerBI, In this Project I have worked on some of the aspects like: Requirements Gathering, Processing the Data, Analyzing the Data and finally building the reports as per the requirements with generating the necessary key insights

In the process of building this project i have used certain tools and operations performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
PostgreSQL: Data Importing,
            Data Retriving from the Database,
            Connecting PostgreSQl to PowerBI for further process like building Dashboards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
PowerBI   : After connecting to the PostgreSQL following steps were performed 

Loading tables to Transform the Data : Data cleaning like removing irreavant data like null values,duplicate values, formatting the data etc.                         
Data modelling : Building relations through the primary key in the(Fact Table) to the foreign keys in the (Dimension Tables).               
Data Processing : Performing certain DAX measures by the tables data as per requirements.
