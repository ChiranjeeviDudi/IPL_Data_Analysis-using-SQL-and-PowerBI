# IPL_Data_Analysis_Project using PostgreSQL and PowerBI
This project is developed for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset for finding the key values of the data very easily in the form of visuals
In this project i have used tools like PostgreSQL and PowerBI, In this Project I have worked on some of the aspects like: Requirements Gathering, Processing the Data, Analyzing the Data and finally building the reports as per the requirements with generating the necessary key insights

In the process of building this project i have used certain tools and operations performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
POSTGRESQL: Data Importing,
            Data Retriving from the Database,
            Connecting PostgreSQl to PowerBI for further process like building Dashboards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
POWERBI   : After connecting to the PostgreSQL following steps were performed 

Loading tables to Transform the Data : Data cleaning process in Power Query Editor like removing irreavant data like null values,duplicate values, formatting the data etc.                         
Data modelling : Building relations through the primary key in the(Fact Table) to the foreign keys in the (Dimension Tables).               
Data Processing : Performing certain DAX functions for tables data as per requirements.                                                                           
Data Visualization : Dealing with visuals data is be used to represent like in Bar Charts, Maps, Line Charts, KPI Cards, Pie Charts etc.
